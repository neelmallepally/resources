  Goal 1: We want to convert this application into cloud native application by using Dapr and containers.
    Actions: 
    1. Fork the repository from original author.
    2. Run the project locally and make sure it loads and you are able to do some actions.
    3. Look at eShopOnContainers and take that as basis for converting YABT to cloud native application.
